## Global Mean Implementation Idea

### Global Average

The global mean implementation idea is based on the assumption that the overall rating behavior is consistent across all users and items. The idea is to predict a user's rating for an item based on the global average rating across all users and items.

Mathematically, the global mean can be represented as:

$
		\bar{r} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{R}|} \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} r, \quad \hat{r}_{ui} = \bar{r},
$

where:

* $\bar{r}$ is the global average rating
* $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of all ratings
* $r$ is a rating in the set $\mathcal{R}$
* $\hat{r}_{ui}$ is the predicted rating for user $u$ and item $i$

The implementation steps for the global mean idea are:

### Algorithm

1. **Compute the global average**:
	* Calculate the average rating across all users and items in the training set.
2. **Predict ratings**:
	* Predict the ratings for all user-item pairs in the testing set as the global average.

### Package Python functions

#### global_mean
- *Input*: 'train_rating', 'test_pair'
- *Return*: Predicted ratings.

### Python Implementation
```python
def global_mean(train_rating, test_pair):
    """
    Predict ratings based on the global mean rating.

    Parameters:
    train_rating (array): Array of training ratings
    test_pair (array): Array of user-item pairs for testing

    Returns:
    pred (array): Predicted ratings
    """
    glb_mean_value = train_rating.mean()
    pred = np.full(len(test_pair), glb_mean_value)
    
    return pred
```
