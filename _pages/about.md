This course will give a conceptual introduction, implementation, and interpretation of the data scientist‚Äôs toolbox in practice. There are three components to this course. The first is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the project like Python, Colab, Jupyter notebook, markdown. The second is a conceptual introduction to A/B test. The third is about Case Studies of A/B Test based on the Toolbox.

üëå **What you'll learn:**

- Understand principles behind statistical inference and A/B test;
- Familiar with Data Science Toolbox: Python (numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn), Colab; Jupyter notebook, Markdown;
- Analyze continuous and categorical data using statistics, Python programming based on Colab and software as appropriate;
- Ability in using advanced Python tools to describe, summarize, and visualize dataset;
- Understand and implement good coding practices, including statistical inference on A/B test, and statistical learning/prediction based on tabular data.

üèóÔ∏è **Prerequisites:**

- **Calculus & Linear algebra**: inner product, matrix-vector product.
- **Basic Statistics**: **STAT1011 level statistics**, basics of distributions, probabilities, conditional probability, mean, standard deviation, etc.
- **Python**: basic grammar; numpy, pandas
