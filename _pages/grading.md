üë®‚Äçüíª **Coursework:**

Homework Assignments (15%): Three homework assignments will be given, each requiring submission of a well-documented *Jupyter Notebook*.

- Homework 1 (5%): Implementing k-fold cross-validation
- Homework 2 (5%): Practicing ALS-related algorithms
- Homework 3 (5%): Prototyping neural networks in recommender systems using TensorFlow

- **InClass Kaggle Competition** (50%): Open-book InClass Kaggle Competition.
  - Round 1 (5%): Implement baseline recommender system methods and get familiar with the Kaggle competition platform.
  - Round 2 (45%): Implement SVD recommender system methods.

- **Final InClass Quiz** (coding and exercise) (35%): Basic Python programming and implementation of recommender systems models (during the final lecture of the semester)

<!-- üë®üèª‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüë®üèæ **Collaboration policy**: we admit you to form a group to finish your real application projects. The number of group members should be smaller or equal than 2. The contribution of each member should be clearly stated in the final report. You will receive 5% points (of the project) if you work solo to projects. -->

üìù **Honesty**: Our course places very high importance on honesty in coursework submitted by students, and adopts a policy of [*zero tolerance*](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/policy/academichonesty/Eng_htm_files_(2013-14)/index_page2.htm) on academic dishonesty. 

üì¢ **(Late) submission**: Homework/projects are submitted via [BlackBoard](https://blackboard.cuhk.edu.hk/ultra). We will *penalize* **10%** credits per 12 hours for the late submission (up to a maximum of 50% penalization.).
