👨‍💻 **Coursework:**

  - HW 3 (5%): A/B Test Exercise

- **Final project / Essay** (55%): A full data analysis provided in form of pdf report and Jupyter notebook. (1) An executable notebook containing the performed analysis on the data; (2) A technique report includes the (i) A/B test you used (ii) result analysis

<!-- 👨🏻‍🤝‍👨🏾 **Collaboration policy**: we admit you to form a group to finish your real application projects. The number of group members should be smaller or equal than 2. The contribution of each member should be clearly stated in the final report. You will receive 5% points (of the project) if you work solo to projects. -->

📝 **Honesty**: Our course places very high importance on honesty in coursework submitted by students, and adopts a policy of [*zero tolerance*](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/policy/academichonesty/Eng_htm_files_(2013-14)/index_page2.htm) on academic dishonesty. 

📢 **(Late) submission**: Homework/projects are submitted via [BlackBoard](https://blackboard.cuhk.edu.hk/ultra). We will *penalize* **10%** credits per 6 hours for the late submission.
