  - Homework 3 (5%): Prototyping neural networks in recommender systems using TensorFlow

- **In-Class Kaggle Session** (50%): Open-book in-class Kaggle session.
  - Lab Attendance (5%): Attendance in the lab sessions is mandatory. You will receive 5% credit if you attend all lab sessions.
  - Kaggle Competition (45%): Implement SVD recommender system methods.

<!-- üë®üèª‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüë®üèæ **Collaboration policy**: We allow you to form a group to finish your real application projects. The number of group members should be no more than 2. The contribution of each member should be clearly stated in the final report. You will receive 5% bonus points (of the project) if you work solo on projects. -->

üìù **Academic Honesty**: Our course places very high importance on honesty in coursework submitted by students, and adopts a policy of [*zero tolerance*](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/policy/academichonesty/Eng_htm_files_(2013-14)/index_page2.htm) on academic dishonesty. 

üì¢ **Late Submission**: Homework and submissions are submitted via [BlackBoard](https://blackboard.cuhk.edu.hk/ultra). We will *penalize* **10%** credit per 12 hours for late submissions (up to a maximum of 50% penalization).
